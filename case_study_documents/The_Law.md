If you want to operate any business on the public sidewalks or streets
you would need a general vendors license. However the sign-up for the
general vendor waiting list closed in November. Only veterans are not
required to be on the general vendor waiting list to get a general
vendor license. You should discuss other options with NYC Dept. of Small
Business Services . Here is a link to their website.

The last day to sign up for the waitlist was November 2016. Last time,
it took 16 years to complete the waitlist.
